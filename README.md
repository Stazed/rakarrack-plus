To build both rakarrack-plus and LV2s, from top checkout directory:
```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install (as root)
```
To remove:
```bash
    make uninstall (as root)
```
Carla presets can be generated and installed by setting the "BuildCarlaPresets"
flag (OFF by default). Use:

    cmake -DBuildCarlaPresets=ON ..

To build Rakarrack-plus only set "BuildLV2Plugins" to OFF:

    cmake -DBuildLV2Plugins=OFF ..
    
To build LV2s only set "BuildRakarrackPlus" to OFF:

    cmake -DBuildRakarrackPlus=OFF ..

To disable NTK embedded LV2 build set "BuildRakarrackPlusLV2" to OFF:

    cmake -DBuildRakarrackPlusLV2=OFF ..

To enable NTK standalone build set "EnableNTK" to ON:

    cmake -DEnableNTK=ON ..
