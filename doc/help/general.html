<p>RAKARRACK-PLUS is a multi-effect processor for guitar players but the
signal processing engine allows a full range of parameter adjustment
making it suitable for almost any audio processing task.
Forty-seven effects are included in this version: Arpie, Cabinet, Chorus,
CoilCrafter, CompBand, Compressor, Convolotron, Derelict, DistBand, Distortion,
Dual Flange, EQ, Echo, Echotron, Echoverse, Exciter, Expander, Flanger,
Harmonizer, Infinity, Looper, MuTroMojo, MusicalDelay, Noise Gate, Opticaltrem,
Overdrive, Pan, Parametric EQ, Phaser, Reverb, Reverbtron, Ring, Sequence,
ShelfBoost, Shifter, Shuffle, StereoHarm, StompBox, Sustainer, Synthfilter,
Valve, VaryBand, Vibe, Vocoder, WahWah .</p>
<p>Ten can be used simultaneously on a chain.</p> 
<p>Also Rakarrack-plus has a Tuner and a monophonic MIDI
Converter and other features like resampling and Tap Tempo.</p> 
<p>Rakarrack-plus can be managed externally by MIDI. The program receives Program Change and parameters 
can be controlled from Control Change MIDI messages.</p>

<p>The above effects and the MIDIConverter are included as LV2 plugins with the package. In
addition, the Harmonizer and StereoHarm LV2s have extra versions for both MIDI control and
non-MIDI control.</p>

<p>One of the most important things of RAKARRACK-PLUS is that everything
works on a single mouse click. All the effect parameters are on the
screen.</p>

<p>The effects are processed on a chain, the chain order processing
is fully configurable by the user for each preset. The preset saves
all the effects parameters. These presets can be grouped into banks
to manage more efficiently. Saving a preset is as easy as typing a
name.</p>

<p>Rakarrack-plus is capable of generating high volume output. It has Gain
controls in general and some of the effects allow high gain
adjustments. Use these gains with caution because they can produce
unwanted effects. However, a limiter is applied to the final output
which prevents signal level from increasing beyond 0dB. Bear this in
mind, for high gains triggering limiting in the output will initiate
high-ratio hard-knee compression. This is better than hard clipping
distortion, but the audio effect can be undesirable.</p>

<p align="left">Rakarrack-plus is a JACK application, Dave Phillips wrote
some good articles in their blog on how to use Linux audio with jack.
If you don't know about jack, or you have problems running rakarrack-plus,

<h3>INSTALL</h3>

<p>Please read the INSTALL, README and PACKAGERS.README files provided
with rakarrack-plus. You will find there a  list of required dependency
packages and detailed configuration options.</p>



<h3>Warning</h3>


<p>From 0.5.0 version we have included resampling and the convolotron
effect. The quality and settings of resampling must be set with
extreme care, because they use a lot of CPU resources. In fact most
computers can't afford the "Best" resampling quality if the amount of
resampling is "x4" or greater. The resampling process makes each effect use
more CPU resources because they need to process more samples. If you combine the
wrong settings with convolotron or harmonizer effects that also use a lot CPU resources the results can be
unpredictable. Wrong settings can hang up your computer. You have been warned.
</p>

<p>Of course resampling increases the sound quality. The way to set up
is start with the worst resampling settings, amount = "x2" and
Quality "Linear". The jack load CPU value is displayed in the
status bar in the preset block. If you want more accurate CPU usage
values use top, htop or
other CPU monitors. Then increase the values assuming that the next
step in quality could use double the CPU versus the current set. That is not
exact in the lower resampling quality levels, but is more accurate in the high levels.
Experiment to find a good balance between amount and quality settings to obtain the best
sound that your computer can afford. Don't forget that each effect also uses more
CPU with resampling. The best result is to set the resampling settings
using a preset that has five or six effects.
</p>

<p>Convolotron has a "Safe Mode" parameter, that "magically" limits the
length of the Impulse Response file read. This is safe because it limits
the CPU usage. The maximum length is calculated reading the bogomips and
is not dynamic and does not measure other tasks that your computer may be
performing. We have been careful to calculate this maximum value, but
if you use resampling, this "safe" value can be invalid. It may cause,
depending of the Impulse Response file read, the convolotron effect to
have no sound. This can happen if the value is less than 5 ms.</p>

<p>Increasing the length parameter will obtain a better convolotron sound.
If you unset the "Safe Mode" you can set the length to a desired value without
the limit, but do so with extreme care. Check the jack load CPU in the status
bar or use a CPU monitor to see what your computer can afford. 
Do so with small steps and check the CPU usage, or you may hang up your computer.
You have been warned.</p>

<p><b>About Clipping and limiting.</b></p>

<p>Rakarrack-plus includes an output limiter to help you keep the signal at or below
maximum recording levels.  There are two indicator lights along the top of
the display to indicate when limiting and clipping is active.</p>

<p><b>Lmt</b>   Limit.  This is the compressor part of the limiting function.  This
lets you know when the Rakarrack-plus output limiter is automatically reducing volume
because the signal level is too high.</p>

<p><b>Clip</b>  The output limiter is clipping the peaks of the signal.  Usually the
attack of dynamics are clipped for short periods of time before the
compressor catches up with the high signal level.  When the signal level is
extremely high, the peaks will always be clipped.  This is indicated with a
red flashing light.</p>

<p>Both clip and Lmt mean the same thing to you as the user:  Turn down the
output until the lights don't blink, or if they blink, very very
infrequently.  Any time the lights blink, there is some distortion on the
output, and it is probably unwanted distortion.  It will be noticeably
audible distortion if the lights blink frequently, or for long periods of
time.</p>

<p>This is not an arbitrary limit.  This is at the limit where the input to a
recording program such as Ardour or Qtractor will be too hot.  If it was not
clipping in Rakarrack-plus, it would be clipping in Ardour, and would be worse
sounding.  Most sound cards will physically clip on the hardware output at
these levels.  The full range in Rakarrack-plus will produce a full range signal
swing.</p>

<h3><a name="conn"></a>Connecting</h3>

<p>The connections shown in the screenshot correspond to a
motherboard sound card. The guitar is connected to the input line.
Obviously this configuration can vary depending of your sound card.
Rakarrack-plus has two inputs to allow use of stereo devices. The
screenshot shows the connection of a guitar, usually mono aural.</p>

<p><img src="imagenes/jack_conections.jpg" alt="rakarrack Qjackctl Connect" align="bottom" border="1" height="313" vspace="10" width="562"></p>

<h3><a name="aux"></a>Aux Input</h3>
<p>The "aux" audio input is used by the <a href="effects.html#Vocoder">Vocoder</a> effect for voice input. Also it is set as the default input for the <a href="aci.html">Analog Control Interface (ACI)</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="pyb"></a>Presets &amp; Banks</h3>

<p>The state of the rack can be saved to a file at any
time, either pressing the "Export" button or via the menu
File-&gt;Export Preset. The export file is a text file that can
be shared and imported from other users. Rakarrack-plus default extension
is .rkr, but this is not required. These single preset text files do
not have to be kept in the User directory to be used.</p>

<p>Set the preset name here:</p>

<p><img src="imagenes/preset_name1.png" alt="rakarrack Preset Box"></p>

<p>If the user modifies any preset bank, The "compare"
button allows you to compare the sound of the current state of
rakarrack-plus with the original bank preset from which it departed.</p>

<p>You can use banks to store groups of presets. Sixty presets can be
saved on a bank. To include a preset in a bank you must first indicate
the name of the preset on the main screen, open the bank window and click
on a empty slot with the right mouse button. To retrieve a preset
stored in a bank, you must open the window of banks and click the left mouse
button on the preset desired. You can also use the Preset selector on
the main window.</p>

<p>To save a preset in a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Put descriptive name to the preset</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the bank window (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> in a empty place OR</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press the <b>right mouse button</b> on an existing preset if
you wish to overwrite it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve a preset from a bank:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Open the bank window (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <b>left mouse button</b> on the preset</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To swap presets in the window:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Open the bank window (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the <b>left mouse button</b> on the preset, drag and drop on
    the preset you want to swap</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>When rakarrack-plus starts it will load the last bank used from the previous session
unless you specify another bank on the <a href="#cmd">command line</a>.
You can also load/save any bank from the menu File. By default, the
installation included banks are installed with root privileges and cannot be overwritten.
They are installed in the data directory selected during the configure process,
normally in "/usr/share/rakarrack-plus" or "/usr/local/share/rakarrack-plus".
These banks, Default.rkrb, Extra.rkrb and Extra1.rkrb should be copied to another
file and placed in the user directory location if you wish to modify them.
The banks contain default presets developed by <a href="#autores">the
development team and some friends</a> who have contributed in this
facet.</p>

<p> The "1", "2", "3", "U" buttons are for fast bank loading. These buttons
load the Default.rkrb, Extra.rkrb, Extra1.rkrb and the user setting defined bank
set in <a href="#bprefs">User preferences</a>.</p>
<p>In addition three addition special effects banks are also included and can
    be selected from the bank window "User Banks" choice menu.</p>

<p><b>Random</b></p>
<p>The "Random" button generates a random preset. Right mouse button
on the random button will show a configure window. You can adjust how the random button
will generate a preset. By default the random button will select from all rack effects
and randomly choose an individual effect preset. Also the number of active effects will
be randomly determined to a maximum of six. These settings can be changed from the 
random configure window. You can choose to have all parameters of the rack effect
to be set randomly, and exclude any effect from the selection process. In addition,
the number of chosen effects can be set, as well as whether they all should be active
or randomly set as active.</p>
<p>You can also set the parameters to any individual rack effect randomly by right
    mouse button on the effect name from the main window rack.</p>
<p><b>CAUTION!!!</b></p>
<p>When setting any parameters randomly or using the random button,
    you should always set your speaker volume to minimum or off before setting.
    Then apply sound to Rakarrack-plus and watch the output volume meter.
    Setting parameters randomly can result in feedback as well as other issues
    that will maximize the volume!!!</p>

<p><b>Bank Window</b><p/>
<p><img src="imagenes/bank_mgmt.jpg" alt="rakarrack Bank Window" align="bottom" border="1" height="500" width="640"></p>

<p>At the top of the Bank window, the title bar shows the loaded bank.
Click on the individual preset buttons or use the preset counter in the Preset
section to change the preset. The hot keys '+' and '-' can also be used to cycle
through the presets.</p>

<p>Presets marked with (*) use the Select mode in the
Harmonizer effect. This means you need to play a monophonic melody in
the Key/Chord selected. The harmonizer recognizes what note you play
and creates a second voice in the Key/Chord selected.</p>

<p><b>Save Bank</b></p>
<p>Save the currently selected bank showing on the bank window. Ctrl-S can be 
used for the keyboard shortcut. You cannot save the default program banks, so if
you want to save any changes to the default banks, use File/Save. All user 
banks MUST be saved in the user directory <a href="#bprefs">User preferences</a>.
See "User Banks" below for recommended file saving naming for MIDI bank select.
Upon successful saving a brief message will display above the bank presets
indicating the file has been saved and the name and path</p>

<p><b>New Bank</b><p/>
<p>Select button for clearing the bank presets buttons for new user banks.</p>

<p><b>R</b></p>
<p>Reload the User Banks. <b>WARNING:</b> This will re-load the currently active bank.
You will not be prompted for any modified changes. All modifications to the currently
active bank will be lost! Select this button to refresh the "User Banks" choice list
and update all user banks for any changes made since the program started. Useful if
there have been changes to the user banks outside the current program instance. For
example, from a second rakarrack-plus instance.</p>

<p><b>MIDI Program Select</b></p>
<p>The number in [XX] brackets preceeding the label is the MIDI program change
    number that must be sent to select the indicated preset.</p>

<p><b>User Banks</b></p>
<p> The "User Banks" choice displays the available user banks that are in the
directory specified by <a href="#bprefs">User Directory</a> in User preferences.</p>
<p>User banks are loaded on program start by scan of the user directory. The files
are selected by .rkrb extension and will appear in the choice display in alpha
numeric order. The first six CC 0 Bank Select parameters are reserved for
the program provided default banks. From CC 0, parameters 6~127 can be used
for user banks. For best results, files could be named using CC parameter value (PV).</p>

    <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          <p> PV_06_Mybank.rkrb</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p> PV_07_Another.rkrb</p>
      </li>
  </ul>

<p><b>MIDI Bank Select</b></p>
<p>The number in [XX] brackets preceding the bank label is the MIDI CC 0,
    Bank Selection parameter value to send for MIDI bank select.</p>

<h2>Audio Preferences</h2>

<p><img alt="Settings Audio" src="imagenes/settings1.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Fx On at start</b></p>
<p>This option sets the FX On at the start. By default it
is Off.</p>
<p><b>Filter Input DC Offset</b></p>
<p>Input DC Removal. Removes constant offset from input signal.  If you
experience strange behavior with compressor or distortion, or if you see
output signal even when no sound is going in, enable it.  A "cheapo"
sound card or microphone inputs can be sources of this problem.</p>
<p><b>Preserve Gain/Master</b></p>
<p>The Input Gain and Master Volume are stored in the preset and applied
when the preset is loaded.  If this option is enabled, the Input Level and
Master Volume will not be modified when the preset changes.</p>

<p><b>Update Tap Tempo</b></p>
<p>If enabled, the Tempo parameter on any selected preset will be updated with the
Tap Tempo value/settings. By default, the saved Tempo settings from the preset are
used.</p>

<p><b>Limiter before Output Volume</b></p>
<p> Rakarrack-plus uses an invisible end chain Limiter to limit the output signal
level. This option puts the limiter before the Output Volume slider.</p>
<p>The Limiter is a hard-knee compressor with a fast attack time followed by
peak clipping.  It is best to leave this as default since it will have no
effect unless the final output signal is high enough to clip on the input of
Ardour (or other recording program).  Reasons you may wish to put this in
front of the volume control are as follows:</p>
<p>1) It produces a nice overdrive when driven by something "hot" like
ShelfBoost.  Then you can overdrive it and use output the volume to bring the signal
level down to a reasonable recording level.</p>
</p>2) If you need a hard limiter to set the maximum to a certain level, this
may prove to be a useful tool.</p>
<p><b>+6dB Final Limiter</b></p>
<p>This option add 6 dB to the final chain Limiter output signal.</p>

<p><b>Master Upsampling</b></p>
<p>Enable upsampling using libsamplerate. This is the master upsampling that
will affect all sound processing. With this enabled, Rakarrack-plus will
process the effects with a higher sample rate than received from the
sound card.  The master upsample parameters will take effect the next time you
launch rakarrack-plus. Enabling upsampling in Rakarrack-plus will use a lot more computer
CPU resources, and will result in very professional sounding effects.
Take care to adjust all the upsampling settings in small
increments because you can hang your computer if your main processor can not
handle the resampling parameters.  Each level of libsamplerate quality uses
more and more resources, and of course each effect uses more CPU resources
because it needs to process a higher amount of data in the same amount of
time.  We highly recommend to start with Linear quality and amount "x2" and
check your CPU usage with "top", and then increase the amount/quality as
desired.</p>

<p><b>Amount</b></p>
<p>Amount of resampling (x2, x3, x4, x5, x6). This is a multiple of your Jack
samplerate.</p>

<p><b>About Resampling Quality</b></p>
<p>Here is the summary:</p>
<p><b>Best</b>  Best sinc interpolation.</p>
<p><b>Medium</b>  Reduced Bandwidth sinc interpolation.</p>
<p><b>Fastest</b>  Fastest sinc interpolation.</p>
<p><b>Linear</b>  Linear interpolation, not band-limited.</p>
<p><b>Zero Order</b>  Blazingly fast, but does not interpolate.</p>

<p>The only difference between Best, Medium, and Fastest is the bandwidth. 
"Fastest" limits to 80% of the maximum bandwidth, but the interpolation
quality is equal to Best sinc interpolation.  As a general rule, you can
often save some processing requirement by using a lower quality upsampling
setting (Linear, or Zero Order), but it is important to use high quality
downsampling if any of the effects you use add higher harmonics not present
at the input (distortion, Arpie, Harmonizer).</p>

<p>If using Linear or Zero Order resampling it is advisable to use a low-pass
filter on the input (like CoilCrafter or MuTroMojo), then again as the last
in line.  The filter will perform interpolation before the signal is

<p>Resampling has two uses: </p>
<p>1)  Improve the "richness" of filters & Equalizers.  This will by nature
improve the accuracy of the EQ's while making filter effects such as Chorus,
Flanger or Phaser sound more natural.</p>
<p>2)  Reduce the amount of aliasing effect produced by nonlinear distortion. 
      Aliasing:  A digital signal cannot represent any frequency higher than
      1/2 the sampling rate.  Any frequencies introduced to the digital
      system higher than 1/2 sample rate are folded back (aliased) into the
      0 to 1/2 sample rate range.  Generally aliased frequencies are not
      musically related to the original tone, and are often the cause of the
      harsh "digital distortion" sound.</p>
      
<p>When you use a Distortion effect (StompBox, Valve, Overdrive, etc.)
      the nonlinear function used in waveshaping produces harmonics that are
      not found in the original signal.  Many of these harmonics are
      significantly higher than 20kHz, and even go to several hundred kHz. 
      The solution is upsampling.  If you increase the samplerate to several
      times the original, then the "headroom" you have available to
      represent these high frequency harmonic components increases.  Since
      the harmonics decrease in amplitude as frequency increases, then there
      comes a point where the aliasing of these frequencies is
      inaudible.</p> 
      
      <p>The caveat is downsampling.  If you upsample then create these higher
      harmonics, you have to filter this out of the signal before you
      downsample.  The sinc interpolation settings are band-limiting by
      nature, and this is what you want if you regularly use distortion. 
      The process of sinc interpolation removes any frequencies higher than
      1/2 the target samplerate before resampling. It is better to use 2x
      upsampling with linear up and fastest sinc down than to use 4x linear or
      zero order up/down with distortion.  A downsampling process that is
      not band limited to 1/2 target sample rate will defeat the purpose of
      upsampling.  If your CPU can handle it, the best is 6x upsampling with
      fastest sinc for up and down.</p> 
      
      <p>Unless you really need the 16kHz to 20kHz range in your instrument,
      don't use Medium or Best.  Indeed these improve bandwidth, but the
      transient filter response is worse with increasing interpolation
      quality.  Particularly for dynamic or percussive instruments,
      "Fastest" sinc interpolation is the highest quality you can use.</p>
      
      <p>If your CPU can't handle the high quality interpolation, you can put
      MuTroMojo on the end of the FX chain and balance between filter
      cut-off frequency and stages to get good rejection at 16-20kHz.</p> 
      
      <p>Finally, it is mathematically proven that sinc interpolation with
      infinite length will PERFECTLY reconstruct the original analog input
      signal in the case of infinite upsampling.  This will also perfectly
      reproduce what the signal would be if sampled at the higher samplerate
      (since infinite upsampling is impossible).  Another impossible thing
      is an infinitely long sinc function.  Sinc interpolation uses a
      Windowed Sinc function of a length where the imperfections introduced
      by truncation create errors of magnitude less than the anticipated
      noise floor.  Based on this theory, many high end CD players use up to
      128x oversampling in the digital-to-analog conversion process.</p>
      
      <p>For somebody who doesn't understand mathematics, this means that you
      don't get ugly distortions by downsampling, say to 16kHz, then back to
      48000.  You only lose bandwidth.  Downsampling to 16kHz then back to
      48kHz is no worse than applying a low-pass filter at 6.4kHz (80% of
      16kHz/2) for fastest sinc, while you will gain some bandwidth nearing
      8kHz for Best quality sinc.  Most amp cabinet responses tend to roll
      off near 5kHz or 6 kHz.  For reverb, this is not much different than
      increasing the "damp" parameter.  Limiting bandwidth near 6.4kHz means
      you don't lose as much quality as you would think from what seems such
      an abysmally low samplerate while it is amazing how little CPU usage
      is required to use Reverbtron and Convolotron with internal samplerate
      set this low.  If you use linear or zero order, all bets are off --
      unless you apply band limiting filtering elsewhere, or know for a fact
      that the input signal does not have any harmonics above 8kHz. 
      Incidentally, you can probably get some amazingly high quality bass +
      bass cabinet sounds with Convolotron set to 16kHz internal
      samplerate.</p>
      


<p><b>Up Sampling Quality</b></p>

<p>Upsampling quality, select the libsamplerate quality
for the upsampling procedure.</p>

<p><b>Down Sampling Quality</b></p>
<p>Downsampling quality, select the libsamplerate quality for the downsampling procedure.</p>

<p><b>Looper Size Seconds</b></p>
<p>Is the size in seconds of the buffer for the Looper effect. The memory is
allocated when Rakarrack-plus starts, so you will need to restart Rakarrack-plus for
this to take effect.  If you do not plan to use the Looper, then make this a
small number so Rakarrack-plus does not hog memory you are not going to use.</p>

<p><b>Looper Metronome Volume</b></p>
<p>This is to adjust the Looper Metronome Volume</p>

<p><b>Tuner Calibration A440</b></p>
<p> Here you can calibrate the Tuner, this also calibrates the MIDI
Converter, Ring and Harmonizer recognize note functions.</p>
<p><b>Recognize Note Trigger</b></p>
<p>This is the trigger for the Recognize Note function used by Harmonizer,
StereoHarm and Ring. The default value is ".6" but better results may be
achieved if you reduce this value. The note recognition also depends on the
input signal level. A balance between this value and the input signal level
is necessary to achieve the best results.</p>

<p><b>Recognize Note Optimization</b></p>
<p>This option filters the data sent to the Recognize Note functions to
the specified frequency range of various instruments</p>

<h2>Quality Preferences</h2>
<p><img alt="Settings Quality" src="imagenes/settings6.jpg"></p>

<p>All settings on the Quality tab are now immediate. There is no
longer a need to restart Rakarrack-plus for the settings to take affect.
The process of changing the quality settings is NOT real-time safe.
For this reason, all effect processing must be bypassed briefly during
the quality change. If a sound is being played during the change you
will hear the unprocessed sound for a brief moment. After the quality
change, all effect settings will be resumed with the change.


<p><b>Harmonizer, Sequence, StereoHarm and Shifter Quality</b></p>
<p>Selects the quality of the audio engine, used by Harmonizer,
Shifter and Sequence effects. The available values are "4,8,16,32"
and the default value is "4". Incrementing the quality increments
the CPU usage by this effect. Take special care if you are
using resampling also.</p>

<p><b> Harmonizer, Reverbtron, Convolotron, Sequence, Shifter, Vocoder and
StereoHarm Downsample</b></p>
<p> Here you can select the sample rate that each effect uses internally.
This can make it possible to use effects with higher CPU demand simply by
trading bandwidth.  For example, if you are resampling at 2x or 3x (master
resample setting), you will need to limit the sample rate of some effects in
order to be able to use certain presets. Of course that may reduce the sound
quality, but certainly you can find a good balance between CPU power and
quality.   Keep the "About Resampling Quality" information in mind when
deciding what to select. </p> 

<p><b>Whaveshape Resampling</b></p>
<p> Distortion, Overdrive, Derelict, DistBand and StompBox effects use the
waveshape internal class to saturate the signal. This process produces aliasing.
Here you can resample in order to eliminate the aliasing which will increase CPU 
usage. Notice that this resample is multiplied by the normal resampling.
For example, if master resampling is 2x, and you select 2x for Waveshape,
then Waveshape internal resampling will be 4x jack sample rate.
The balance you need to find is between the number of resampling
operations, quality of resampling, and resampling amount.  For example, if
you are only using Stompbox and maybe reverb in a preset, then it may be
better to set 4x fast sinc interpolation for master resample than to use
Waveshape resampling.  If you are using other effects, and some higher CPU
effects, then it may be better to use 2x master resample with linear
up/down, then 2x Waveshaper resample with linear up, fastest sinc down.</p>

<h3><a name="session"></a>Session Support</h3>

<p>Rakarrack-plus supports NSM, both Non Session Manager as well as New Session
Manager.
For session management, the current instance Settings/Preferences are saved as well as last
used bank and preset. In addition, gui show/hide is supported. All bank, user files,
Program Change table and "Insert" presets are global to all instances.
For each Rakarrack-plus instance in the NSM session you must set the User bank in
Settings/Preferences/User to your global user bank. SIGUSR1(save) and SIGINT(quit) signals
can also be used for session support.
</p>

<p><b>NSM Single State</b></p>
<p>In Settings/Preferences/Misc: Check this box if you want NSM session to always save the
